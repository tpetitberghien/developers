## [front/react] Github user search

## Instructions
,,
Create an input text in which as the user types in, launch a search against
Github users and return a result list.

### The subject

1. Query against Github Api: GET https://api.github.com/search/users?q={USER}.
2. Try to not add any dependency library on a freshly created
   [create react app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
3. Don't forget to check against modern ways to make HTTP requests on frontend side.
4. Bonus: manage edge cases (no results, github api rate limit)

### Guidelines

- Use React.js to render the view
- Push your code to a Github repository
- Document what you've done

### Evaluation

- Quality of the code
- Scalability of the algorithm
- Usage of good practices and modern javascript
